# CV of Johan Nordberg

I solve problems using technology. 

My entire life, I have been deeply engaged in the world of programming. The ability to identify a problem and envision an efficient solution through software has always captivated me. When I was about 10 years old, my older sisters boyfriend showed me GW Basic in MS-DOS. Then I knew what I wanted to work with for the rest of my life. 

Professionally, my career began in 1997 at a prominent Swedish web development agency, where I immersed myself in web and app development. Since then, I have gained extensive experience working in diverse environments, including larger agencies, small companies, co-owned ventures, and as a self-employed professional. In recent years, I have had the pleasure of working as a **Cloud Solution Architect** with a focus on **app innovation** and **sustainability** at Microsoft. Alongside my professional commitments, I continue to maintain and contribute to projects and applications through my own company.

## Technology skills 

Throughout my career, I have moved between frontend, backend, database, and app development. Whether working in smaller teams or managing my own projects, I have prioritized gaining a deep understanding of the full stack. This versatility allows me to move between different technologies and deliver from zero to production. 

### .NET
I have consistently relied on the **.NET** eco system. I began with Classic ASP, VB, and COM+. When the .NET framework was introduced, I transitioned to it. With the advent of **.NET Core**, I embraced it for new projects, leveraging its modern capabilities, improved performance and most of all its cross platform capabilities.

During the years I’ve build both full web sites and high performant API:s using .NET, serving many users while using cheap hardware.

### React & Next.js
After working on the frontend with various frameworks and patterns, like Jquery, Angular, Knockout, etc., I tried **React** and got hooked. Since around 2014 all my frontend development has been in **React** or **Next.js**. The combination of React & TypeScript felt natural to me and took away many of the biggest pains with frontend development. 

### Node.js
When I started using React and Next.js, it also made sense to use TypeScript and Node for API’s and backend programming. Depending on the use case, I choose ASP.NET Core or **Node.js**. Both have their own pros and cons and I feel comfortable using either. 

One of the largest projects I still maintain rely on **Express** js for backend API:s and Next.js for the web frontend. 

### Native apps
Around the time the iPad was released, I started building educational apps for schools. Back then, doing it natively was the only option, which meant learning **Objective C** for iOS and **Java** for Android. Over the years I switched to **Swift** and **Kotlin**. I still maintain a couple of these apps with both Objective C and Swift.

### React Native
For new app projects I mainly use **React Native**. Having the same stack for both web and app helps with productivity and avoiding context switching. As a solo developer, React Native has played a huge part in making me productive enough to publish apps both on iOS, Android and Web. 

### Relational Databases
**Microsoft SQL Server** was the first database I worked with (starting in 1997). I still use it for many projects. Over the years I’ve used **PostgreSQL** more. I’ve also worked with NoSQL databases like **RavenDB** and I have **Azure Cosmos DB** certification.

## Employments

### Microsoft (2021-11 - )
At Microsoft I have gained a lot of knowledge around building scalable high performant cloud native solutions. As a cloud solution architect, my responsibility has been helping our partners and ISV’s to be successful in the cloud. Working with sustainability and making green software also has been a core part of my role. Much of my time is spent on educating partners and customers in new technology. 

I co-host the [Microsoft Partner Podcast](https://aka.ms/partnerpodden). 

### Digitalt Hjärta (2014 - )
[Digitalt Hjärta](https://digitalthjarta.se) (Digital Heart) is my private company. I started it as a part time job while employed at an agency. Mainly, I focused on building apps for schools. When this became more successful, I quit my employment and worked full-time on my own projects. I still maintain many of these apps and services. Visit [digitalthjarta.se](https://digitalthjarta.se) to see projects I made.

### Projector (2008 - 2014)
Projector was a digital advertisement agency. There I was part of many fun and crazy projects, blending software, hardware and installations. We built [games for Samsung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qq_yYDBjWo), [Charioke with Say Lou Lou](https://vimeo.com/262992557), strange [christmas presents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PGIitOX1i8) and a competition where you should [impress Megan Fox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-n0ibhbxTA). I worked in a team of four developers, graphics artists and copywriters.

### Spider (2002 - 2008)
Spider mainly worked with Microsoft Office education and custom solutions like templates. When I joined, it focused more on big software projects. I worked with large customers like Proctor & Gamble, H&M and Tetrapak.

### 24/7 Interactive (1999 - 2002)
24/7 Interactive was founded and owned by me and five other people from prominent web agencies in Stockholm. The company was partly owned by the ad agency Grey. 

### Cell Networks (1997 - 1999)
At Cell I was the first employee, except for the founders. This was an amazing learning journey. There I got to work with people I still think are the best mentors I’ve had during my career.
